# 11.2 Emergency Access Admin Accounts

Emergency access or 'break-glass' accounts are accounts used to restore access to an environment or tenant. Break-glass accounts are an option of last resort and should only be used when normal administrative accounts cannot be used to restore access. Example of this is where conditional access has malfunctioned and both users and administrative staff are unable to authenticate into the environment, or all privileged administrator accounts are comprised in another capacity.

[Microsoft best practice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-emergency-access) recommends that two break-glass accounts are configured. These accounts should be stored according to the standard break-glass procedures. Best practice is for these accounts to meet the following minimum requirements:

* They are not to be associated with any individual user.
* They will use a different authorisation mechanism than standard administrative accounts.
* They are cloud only accounts that use the '\*.onmicrosoft.com' domain.
* The passwords to these accounts are set to never expire or be cleaned up or removed due to inactivity.
* The accounts are to be given the Global Administrator role assigned permanently.
* At least one of the accounts is to be excluded from Multi Factor Authentication \(MFA\).
* At least one of the accounts is to be completely excluded from all Conditional Access policies.
* The accounts are stored on paper, in two or three separate parts, in secure, fireproof safes that are in disparate locations.
* Use of these accounts is monitored and only used in genuine emergencies.

Emergency access account Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

| Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Emergency Access accounts | Configured | Two emergency access accounts will be configured in alignment to Microsoft and security best practice. |

Emergency access account configuration for all agencies and implementation types

| Configuration | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Username | Any value that is not associated to a specific user. | Accounts are not to be associated with any individual user. |
| Account type | Accounts are cloud only accounts that use the '\*.onmicrosoft.com' domain. | Only \*.onmicrosoft.com accounts should be used as per Microsoft best practice. |
| Password Expiry | Passwords are set to never expire. | Ensures the passwords for these accounts are valid in an emergency. |
| Roles | Emergency Access accounts will be assigned the Global Administrator role. | The accounts are to be given the Global Administrator role assigned permanently. |
| MFA | Both Emergency Access accounts will be excluded from MFA. | Multi Factor Authentication \(MFA\) device may not be available when the emergency access account is required. |
| Conditional Access | At least one of the accounts is to be completely excluded from all Conditional Access policies. | The emergency access account may need access to fix an issue and it would not be beneficial if a policy were to block access. |
| Physical access to account details | Account details will be stored on paper in an appropriate location. | It is strongly recommended that the accounts are stored on paper, in two or three separate parts, in secure, fireproof safes that are in disparate locations. |
| Monitoring of accounts | Account usage will be monitored via MCAS. | Use of these accounts is monitored and only used in genuine emergencies. |
