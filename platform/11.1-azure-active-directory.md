# 11.1 Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory \(Azure AD\) is a cloud-based directory service which stores identity information and offers Information and Access Management \(IAM\) for Microsoft cloud products, custom developed applications, and third-party applications. The identities within this directory service can be either cloud based or synchronised from an on-premises AD domain via the Azure AD Connect client.

Azure AD allows users to sign in and access resources like Microsoft Office 365, the Azure management portal, and other SaaS applications. Azure AD also provides control over the following directory activities:

* Registration of applications – The registration of application controls whether users can grant permissions to applications and register them within Azure AD.
* Restriction of the Azure AD administrative portal – The restriction of the Azure AD portal controls who can viewing of the contents of the Azure AD. The contents include user identity data.
* LinkedIn account connection – LinkedIn account connection allows users to link their work account to LinkedIn.
* External user invitations – External user invitation controls who can be invited by users to collaborate within the tenant.
* Azure AD preview features – Azure AD preview features control how new self-service features are made available to users.

Azure IAM is configured using:

* Enterprise Applications - The registration of Microsoft and Third-party enterprise applications. The registration requires information regarding the name, publisher, permissions, authentication configuration and Redirect URIs \(Uniform Resource Identifier\) to be provided.
* App Registrations – The registration of custom-built enterprise applications. The registration requires information regarding the name, Application Identifier \(APP ID\), permissions, authentication configuration and Redirect URIs \(Uniform Resource Identifier\) to be provided.

Where an Agency has already determined that a HYBRID solution is required, [additional considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/plan-hybrid-identity-design-considerations-overview) will apply and these should also be reviewed.

Azure AD Design Decisions for all agencies and implementation types.

| Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cloud Based Service Accounts | Configured | Break glass accounts are required to be cloud based to ensure access to the tenant if there are issues with authentication. |
| Allow the registration of applications by users | Disabled | Only administrators can register applications. |
| Restrict access to the Azure AD administrative portal | Enabled | Only administrators have access to the portal. |
| Allow LinkedIn connections | Disabled | To meet the Agency's requirements not to share information with third party Agencies without approval. |
| External Collaboration | Configured | As required by the Agency, provided the external Agencies are at the same classification. |
| Group Management | Configured | Naming policies and expiration as required by the Agency. |
| Azure Active Directory RBAC | Configured | For ease of administration, segregation and delegation of roles. Users and administrators will be assigned only the roles they need through PIM \(Privileged Identity Management\). |
| Enterprise Applications | Not Configured | No enterprise applications have been identified. |
| Device registration | Not Configured | Default settings. |
| Identity Governance | Not Configured | Default settings. |
| Application Proxy | Not Configured | No requirement has been identified. |
| Licences | Configured | Configured to assign Microsoft 365 licences to user groups. Ensures consistent configuration. |
| Custom Domain Names | Configured | {agency}.onmicrosoft.com {agency}.gov.au |
| Mobility \(MDM and MAM\) | Not Configured | Default settings. |
| Company Branding | Configured | Agency specific logos will be required. |

Additional Azure AD Design Decisions for cloud native implementations

| Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Identity Source | Azure AD | As this is a cloud only implementation Azure AD will be the source of identity. |
| App registration | Not Configured | Default settings. |
| Password Reset | Configured | For self-service password reset, users will need to provide an alternate email address, mobile app and phone number during registration. To reset their password, they will need to provide two methods of verification. |
| Identity Format | Configured | Usernames will conform to firstname.lastname{sequence number} Note: The sequence number is only required if duplicate names would be created. |

Additional Azure AD Design Decisions for hybrid implementations

| Decision Point | Design Decision | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Identity Source | Active Directory | As this is a hybrid implementation Active Directory will be the source of identity. |
| Synchronize to Active Directory | Configured | Cloud identities or Synchronised or Federated in accordance with agency specific requirements. |
| App registration | Configured | Windows Defender ATP – SIEM integration is required. |
| Azure AD Connect | Configured | See Azure AD Connect section for details. |
| Identity Format | Not Configured | Usernames will be synchronised from the on-premises Active Directory and will inherit naming convention. |
